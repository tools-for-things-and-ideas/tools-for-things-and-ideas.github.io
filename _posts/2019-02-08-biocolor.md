With Maria Boto from the [bio-lab](http://laboratorium.bio/) at the School of Arts in Ghent, we did a first test to infuse PLA filament with microalgae pigments. We started from PLA Granulate, added the color powder to it and gave it a good shake to distribute the color onto the surface of the pellets. Then we extruded the pellets in the same way regular PLA filament would be extruded. It's interesting to see how the powder doesn't dissolve, but is rather suspended in the filament. This results in a sparkly texture.

The pigment we start with is the algae produced carotene powder

The base material is PLA granulate

The pigment is added to the granulate and the container is shaken in order to distribute the powder fully on the surface of the pellets

We add the mixture to the filament extruder. We're using the [Next extruder](https://3devo.com/next-filament-extruder/) from 3devo.

The resulting filament is a semi transparent orange with fine color particles suspended in the plastic.

We printed two small test-bars. One is kept in the dark while the other is exposed to sunlight. Because the color is of biological origin, the colors will fade over time. If changes are observed, we will update them here.

Next up was a blue pigment.

This pigment clumped together in dense pigment blobs, resulting in a bad extrusion and a filament that will clogg a 3D printer immediately.

Here you can clearly see the clumped filament blobs.
