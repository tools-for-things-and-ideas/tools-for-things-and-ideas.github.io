Inject or place bee DNA into a 3d printed dodecahedron shape to preserve it for possible futures. An online component is set up that gathers information whilst the shape is being mummified by the bees inside the hive with propolis. Once the dodecahedron is sealed by the bees, data gathering stops, or possibly as long as the battery holds out. OR, put bot-crawled info about bee DNA on a USB stick and seal it within the object. Make a kit and torrent file (online) out of the whole project so people, bee keepers, can mummify the bee DNA and the info for themselves and for posterity. An important element would be to pass on knowledge about how to recreate a bee with DNA.
