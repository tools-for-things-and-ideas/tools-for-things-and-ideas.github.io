Slicers make a 3D printer move in contour lines. This is an efficient method to build up conventional models. But coming from a context of digital images, I wonder if there might be an alternative to this method.
In this experiment, I'll be looking into the possibilities of a [voxel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel) based approach. Instead of lines, the plastic model would be built up droplet per droplet. 
This admittedly unefficient printing method would allow for a more sponge like texture.
