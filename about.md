Welcome to the Formlab for tools, things and ideas (FTT&I (?))


This research project combines a collective of artists, biologists, theoreticians and makers dedicated to enriching the public domain through the research and development of 3d technologies and media. Although this research project has a three year lifespan, ending in 2021, the FTT&I website will remain online as an archive of its projects.
