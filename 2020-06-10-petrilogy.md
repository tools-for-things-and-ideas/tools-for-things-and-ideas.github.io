This collaboration between [Formlab](https://www.formlab.schoolofarts.be/) and [Laboratorium](http://www.laboratorium.bio) is a work in progress. It will result in three short videos imaging different processes in a petri dish.

**Video 1: Faro**

A time lapse of the beautiful Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction.

**Video 2: La Bahía**

A colourful mold in a petri dish looked like a landscape. We converted a picture of the mold to a height map, 3D printed a 3D model of it and reïntroduced the mold to the miniature landscape.
